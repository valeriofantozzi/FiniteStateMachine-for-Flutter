# FiniteStateMachine FSM Model in Dart üö¶

This repository contains a **Finite State Machine (FSM)** model implemented in Dart ü§ñ. The FSM is designed to handle complex state transitions in a structured and scalable manner, making it ideal for applications such as workflows, game development, or any scenario requiring dynamic state management.

---

## **Features** üöÄ

- **Modular Design:** Separate classes for states, events, and transitions for maximum flexibility ‚öôÔ∏è
- **Asynchronous Actions:** Supports async/await for non-blocking operations ‚è∞
- **Entry and Exit Actions:** Execute specific actions on entering and exiting a state üö™
- **Event Queue:** Ensures proper handling of multiple events by processing them sequentially üìú
- **Invalid Event Handling:** Detects and logs events that are not valid for the current state ‚ùå
- **State Stream:** Provides a stream for observing state changes in real time üåê

---

## **Components** üß©

### 1. **MachineState**

The base class for defining states in the FSM.

### 2. **MachineEvent**

The base class for defining events that trigger state transitions.

### 3. **Transition**

Represents a transition between states, including optional entry, exit, and transition actions.

### 4. **StateWithEntryExit**

An extended state class that allows defining custom entry and exit actions for a state.

### 5. **StateMachine**

The main class that:

- Manages the current state.
- Defines the mapping between states, events, and transitions.
- Handles the execution of actions during state transitions.
- Provides a queue for events to ensure ordered processing.

### 6. **Sequence of Events During a Transition**

When you call `stateMachine.addEvent(...)`, the following actions occur in order:

1. üöÄ **Locate the corresponding transition**
2. üèÅ **Execute transitionExitAction (if defined)**
3. üö™ **Execute stateExitAction (if defined)**
4. ‚öôÔ∏è **Execute transitionAction (if defined)**
5. üîÑ **Update the currentState**
6. üèóÔ∏è **Execute transitionEntryAction (if defined)**
7. üì• **Execute stateEntryAction (if defined)**
8. üîî **Notify State Change**

No valid transition?  
If no transition is defined for (current state + event), the event is ignored (or handled as invalid, depending on your logic).


### **5. Add Events**

Trigger events to drive state transitions:

```dart
stateMachine.addEvent(StartEvent());
stateMachine.addEvent(StopEvent());
```

Sequence of Events During a Transition

1. üö¶ **Locate the corresponding transition:** Checks validity.
2. ‚öôÔ∏è **Execute transitionAction:** Runs before changing the state.
3. üîÑ **Update the currentState:** Switches to the new state.
4. üèóÔ∏è **Execute transitionEntryAction:** After state update.
5. ‚ùå **No valid transition?** Event is ignored or handled as invalid.

## **How to Use** ‚öôÔ∏è

### **1. Define Your States**

Create classes extending `MachineState`:

```dart
class IdleState extends MachineState {}
class RunningState extends MachineState {}
```

### **2. Define Your Events**

Create classes extending `MachineEvent`:

```dart
class StartEvent extends MachineEvent {}
class StopEvent extends MachineEvent {}
```

### **3. Create Transitions**

Define transitions between states:

```dart
final startTransition = Transition(
  nextState: RunningState(),
  transitionAction: (context) async {
    print("Starting...");
    return context;
  },
);
```

### **4. Initialize the State Machine**

Set up the FSM:

```dart
final Map<Type, Map<Type, Transition>> transitions = {
  IdleState: {
    StartEvent: startTransition,
  },
  RunningState: {
    StopEvent: Transition(
      nextState: IdleState(),
      transitionAction: (context) async {
        print("Stopping...");
        return context;
      },
    ),
  },
};

final stateMachine = StateMachine(
  context: {},
  state: IdleState(),
  transitions: transitions,
);
```
